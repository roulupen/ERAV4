### üìä Analysis

* The model contains **8.88K parameters**, slightly above the target of **8K parameters**.
* The model reached **99% test accuracy by Epoch 7**.
* It achieved its **best accuracy of 99.45% at Epoch 12**.
* Final accuracy after 15 epochs was **99.44%**, which successfully meets the target of **‚â•99.4%**.
* Batch Normalization layers helped stabilize training and contributed to fast convergence.
* The model architecture is efficient and compact, but minor refinements (like GAP in place of FC) can optimize parameter usage further.
* The training accuracy reached **99.8%**, while the test accuracy plateaued around **99.4%**. This gap indicates **mild overfitting**.
* Adding **regularization techniques** such as **dropout, cutout, or data augmentation** in future runs can reduce this gap.
* **Conclusion**: The current batchnorm-based CNN achieved **99.45% accuracy**, successfully meeting the target within 15 epochs. The model is compact and efficient but can be further optimized by reducing parameters with GAP and improving generalization with regularization strategies (e.g., dropout, cutout).

### üìä Analysis

* The model has **8.88K parameters**, same as the batchnorm version, which is still slightly above the **8K target**.
* Dropout was applied in the **earlier and mid-level convolutional layers**, but **not in the final layers**.
* This design choice helps preserve the critical feature representations learned in the deeper layers while still providing regularization in earlier parts of the network.
* The model crossed **99% test accuracy by Epoch 8**. It achieved its **best test accuracy of 99.37% at Epoch 12**. Final accuracy after 15 epochs was **99.34%**, which is **slightly below the 99.4% target**.
* **Conclusion:** The dropout-augmented CNN achieved **99.37% accuracy**, which is strong but just shy of the **99.4% target**. Dropout provided mild regularization, reducing overfitting compared to the batchnorm-only version, but further tuning (e.g., increasing dropout rate, adding cutout, or parameter reduction via GAP) is needed to both meet the accuracy target and reduce parameters below 8K.

## **MNISTNet4BlockWithBatchNormMaxPoolDropoutAveragePooling ‚Äì GAP CNN**

**Architecture (high-level):**

* Uses **Global Average Pooling (GAP)** instead of a dense FC layer at the end.
* Dramatically reduces parameter count to **7,954 (<8K)**.
* No augmentations used ‚Äî tested pure architecture efficiency.

### üìä Analysis

* Replacing the final convolutional block with **Global Average Pooling (GAP)** reduced the model to **7,954 parameters**, bringing it under the **8K target**.
* Achieved **99% by Epoch 7**, peaked at **99.26% at Epoch 13**.
* However, **training accuracy rose to 99.6% while test plateaued at 99.26%**, showing **overfitting**.
* Met parameter but **failed consistency requirement** (never ‚â•99.4%).
* **Conclusion:** This model stays within the parameter, but it falls short of the 99.4% test accuracy target and shows slight overfitting, as indicated by the widening gap between training and test performance. As the next step, I will add regularization through augmentation techniques.

## **MNISTNet4BlockWithBatchNormMaxPoolDropoutAveragePooling ‚Äì GAP + Data Augmentation (Final Experiment)**

**Architecture (high-level):**

* Uses **Global Average Pooling (GAP)** to keep parameters low (**7,954**).
* Adds **Data Augmentation** to improve generalization.

### üõ†Ô∏è Augmentations Applied

* **RandomAffine**: small rotations (¬±10¬∞), translations (up to 8%), scaling (95‚Äì108%), shear (¬±8¬∞).
* **RandomPerspective** (25% probability): slight perspective warping for viewpoint robustness.
* **Cutout (RandomErasing)**: erases 2‚Äì15% of the image to prevent over-reliance on single features.
* **Normalization**: standard MNIST normalization (mean=0.1307, std=0.3081).

# üèÜ Conclusion

Through iterative experimentation, we:

1. **Started with BatchNorm CNN** (Good model architecture as the test accuracy hit 99.4% target but it was overfitting and the parameter count was more than 8k).
2. **Tried Dropout CNN** (The paramter count was same as last model but here by applying dropout the overfitting was reduced).
3. **Introduced GAP CNN** (The paramter count was reduced by using global average pooling instead of final convolution layer so the model paramter count was less than 8k, but the test accuracy was lower than the targte and model was still overfitting which suggested to apply other regularization techniques such as image augmentation).
4. **Finalized GAP + Data Augmentations** (This model is the best model so far from the experiments it acheives the test accuracy 99.4 and the model is not overfitting with training of few more epoch could provide better test accuracy).

üëâ Final model achieved:

* **99.46% accuracy** within **15 epochs**.
* Consistently ‚â• **99.4% from Epoch 12 onwards**.
* **7,954 parameters**, under the 8K parameter.
